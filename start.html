<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70242311"
target="_blank" title="ORANGE IS THE NEW BLAKC=NETFLIX"><strong> <U>Orange</U> is the new black</STRONG></a> is one of the best Drama for <U>the weakest people</U> in the world
<p>When I first saw Piper, I felt little bit of familiarence, and little arrogance.
When I saw Alex, at the first time I felt little bit of scared, little bit of turned up, little bit of craziness.</p><p style="margin-top:20px">

My favorite character is Pussey, who is black littel girl, lesbian and very cute but also so strong. And she likes lovely friend and I felt
kinda sympathy, because i had simmilar experience all the time.
I like the way that drama say. </p>
